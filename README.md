I built a project that uses a Linked List data structure to store all student data after extracting it from a .csv file. I implemented functions such as Sort and Search to analyze the data efficiently. Additionally, I developed features to compute placement statistics such as mean, median, and minimum-maximum packages. Based on this information, I categorized companies into Dream and Super Dream categories. I also created a function named ‘acceptance rate’, which helped in developing a ‘trajectory’ to guide future batches in their placement preparation.
